# CalcX


CalcX is a developed interpreter for a new programming language using a given Syntax Direct Translated Scheme and a Context Free Grammar.

The programs  can  contain  several expressions, rather than just one, with each being split by colons “:”. Each expression, once 
evaluated, should output a value followed by a colon “:“ and output “END” once all expressions are evaluated. Therefore, the following code example should be valid in your new language and would output “33:1:END”: 

INT x = 20; INT y = 7; : x+x – y : y+y+y-x $ 


SDTS and CFGs with the designed parse tree can be found in the Theory.pdf file
